About Build and Deploy a Full Stack MERN AI Image Generation App
 I have developed a full-stack MERN application that creates AI-generated images and stores them in a database.
 React.js and Tailwind CSS were used for the front-end, while the back-end runs on Node.js and is connected to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
 To optimize the server, we used Cloudinary's Media API, which converts the image into a URL
